## Description

In this project, I was able to create a Token Price Checker dApp that allows users to find the price of a certain token via ETH blockchain. The API used was through Moralis SDK which when applied allows prices to appear via the dApp. When working on the project, I also gained knowledge in the cloud functions that Moralis offers as well as switch the price feed from ETH to BNB as well. I also used Materialize for the frontend framework.
